# Discord-TTS-Bot (currently broken)
**Warning**: It is currently not working at all because Vocodes/FakeYou and Discord itself have changed a lot...I might update it in the future.

This is a Discord bot that utilizes the Vocodes TTS voices can make celebrities, politicians, sci-fi characters etc. say whatever you want in discord voice channels. To use it you need your own discord developer account because the bot is currently not hosted and has to be launched whenever you want to utilize it. The bot is capable of many voices and uses discord slash commands to make it ver yuser friendly.

Voice Sample:
