# Discord-TTS-Bot (currently broken)
**Warning**: The bot is currently not working at all because Vocodes/FakeYou and Discord itself have changed a lot...I might update it in the future.

This is a Discord Text-To-Speech bot that utilizes the Vocodes TTS voices - capable of making celebrities, politicians, sci-fi characters etc. say whatever you want in a discord voice channel. To use it you need your own discord developer account because the bot is currently not hosted and has to be launched whenever you want to utilize it. It is capable of many different voices and uses discord slash commands to make it very user-friendly.

To add it to your server:
1. Open the **cog.py** file and paste your Discord servers guild ID in the **"guild_ids"** array
2. Create a .env file specifying your Discord Developer Token like this: TOKEN = 'your_token'
3. Install the required Python libraries
4. Run **bot.py**
